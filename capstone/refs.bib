  abstract  = {The bottle-neck in most cloth simulation systems is that time steps must be small to avoid numerical instability. This paper describes a cloth simulation system that can stably take large time steps. The simulation systemcouples a new technique for enforcing constraints on individual cloth particles with an implicit integration method. The simulator models cloth as a triangular mesh, with internal cloth forces derived using a simple continuum formulation that supports modeling operations such as local anisotropic stretch or compression; a unified treatment of damping forces is included as well. The implicit integration method generates a large, unbanded sparse linear system at each time step which is solved using a modified conjugate gradient method that simultaneously enforces particles' constraints. The constraints are always maintained exactly, independent of the number of conjugate gradient iterations, which is typically small. The resulting simulation system is significantly faster than previous accounts of cloth simulation systems in the literature.},

  abstract   = {We present a general framework for the garment animation problem through unsupervised deep learning inspired in physically based simulation. Existing trends in the literature already explore this possibility. Nonetheless, these approaches do not handle cloth dynamics. Here, we propose the first methodology able to learn realistic cloth dynamics unsupervisedly, and henceforth, a general formulation for neural cloth simulation. The key to achieve this is to adapt an existing optimization scheme for motion from simulation based methodologies to deep learning. Then, analyzing the nature of the problem, we devise an architecture able to automatically disentangle static and dynamic cloth subspaces by design. We will show how this improves model performance. Additionally, this opens the possibility of a novel motion augmentation technique that greatly improves generalization. Finally, we show it also allows to control the level of motion in the predictions. This is a useful, never seen before, tool for artists. We provide of detailed analysis of the problem to establish the bases of neural cloth simulation and guide future research into the specifics of this domain.},

Elastically deformable models are active: they respond in a natural way to applied forces, constraints, ambient media, and impenetrable obstacles. The models are fundamentally dynamic and realistic animation is created by numerically solving their underlying differential equations. Thus, the description of shape and the description of motion are unified.},

  abstract   = {Computation of bending forces on triangle meshes is required for numerous simulation and geometry processing applications. In particular it is a key component in cloth simulation. A common quantity in many bending models is the hinge angle between two adjacent triangles. This angle is straightforward to compute, and its gradient with respect to vertex positions (required for the forces) is easily found in the literature. However, the Hessian of the bend angle, which is required to compute the associated force Jacobians is not documented in the literature. Force Jacobians are required for efficient numerics (e.g., implicit time stepping, Newton-based energy minimization) and are thus highly desirable. Readily available computations of the force Jacobian, such as those produced by symbolic algebra systems, or by autodifferentiation codes, are expensive to compute and therefore less useful. We present compact, easily reproducible, closed form expressions for the Hessian of the bend angle. Compared to automatic differentiation, we measure up to 7x speedup for the evaluation of the bending forces and their Jacobians.},

We present a novel ℓ1-regularized maximum likelihood method for performant large-scale sparse precision matrix estimation utilizing the block structures in the underlying computations. We identify the computational bottlenecks and contribute a block coordinate descent update as well as a block approximate matrix inversion routine, which is then parallelized using a shared-memory scheme. We demonstrate the effectiveness, accuracy, and performance of these algorithms. Our numerical examples and comparative results with various modern open-source packages reveal that these precision matrix estimation methods can accelerate the computation of covariance matrices by two to three orders of magnitude, while keeping memory requirements modest. Furthermore, we conduct large-scale case studies for applications from finance and medicine with several thousand random variables to demonstrate applicability for real-world datasets.}

The simulated flock is an elaboration of a particle systems, with the simulated birds being the particles. The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is created by a distributed behavioral model much like that at work in a natural flock; the birds choose their own course. Each simulated bird is implemented as an independent actor that navigates according to its local perception of the dynamic environment, the laws of simulated physics that rule its motion, and a set of behaviors programmed into it by the "animator." The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is the result of the dense interaction of the relatively simple behaviors of the individual simulated birds.},

  abstract  = {Building animation tools for fluid-like motions is an important and challenging problem with many applications in computer graphics. The use of physics-based models for fluid flow can greatly assist in creating such tools. Physical models, unlike key frame or procedural based techniques, permit an animator to almost effortlessly create interesting, swirling fluid-like behaviors. Also, the interaction of flows with objects and virtual forces is handled elegantly. Until recently, it was believed that physical fluid models were too expensive to allow real-time interaction. This was largely due to the fact that previous models used unstable schemes to solve the physical equations governing a fluid. In this paper, for the first time, we propose an unconditionally stable model which still produces complex fluid-like flows. As well, our method is very easy to implement. The stability of our model allows us to take larger time steps and therefore achieve faster simulations. We have used our model in conjuction with advecting solid textures to create many fluid-like animations interactively in two- and three-dimensions.},
